Developed a PowerBI dashboard aimed at facilitating the air cargo industry's transition towards a net-zero emissions mission. The dashboard utilizes a data model sourced from the 1 record API provided by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for real-time emissions calculations. The tool not only identifies areas for improvement but also supports strategic decision-making, enabling organizations to compensate for and offset their carbon footprint effectively.
